Harm others plan
Die immediately
Overdose on purpose
Jump off a bridge
Hanging myself
Slit my wrists
Bleeding to death
Consuming poison
Shoot myself
Gun to my head
No reason to live
Saying goodbye forever
Last breath

Life-ending decision
Unbearable pain
Final moments

Beyond help
Permanently end suffering
No turning back
Dying alone

Immediate relief
Vanishing forever
Unrecoverable state
Terminal decision
Dead end
No hope left
Extreme despair
Last resort
Incurable agony
Final departure
Eternal silence
Inescapable pain
Never waking up
Last breath taken
No recovery
Beyond rescue
Leaving this world
Die
Kill
